Contrary to her character, Mizuchi is the most wholesome touhou at **80.28%**. As a fairly new and incomplete character this is unsurprising, though she does beat out many other niche characters.

With **12.38%** Miyoi is the horniest touhou by a solid 3 point margin. I don't really get it.

# Methodology:
The metrics were gathered based on danbooru image counts.
The character list is taken from https://maribelhearn.com/thvote. I then manually converted this list into the coresponding danbooru tags and dropped some obscure and non-humanoid characters. It's possible that there are some missing due to errors in my process. If you find that your favorite touhou is missing, please let me know so that I can fix it.
Lonelyness is based on the 'solo' tag, wholesomeness and hornyness are based on 'rating:general' and 'rating:explicit', shipability is based on the 'yuri' tag, and kinkyness is based on the combination of the 'bondage', 'exhibitionism' and 'tentacles' tags.
